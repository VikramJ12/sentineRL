To implement <b> reinforcement learning (RL)</b> for swarm surveillance in your game, you model each drone as an <b>RL agent</b> that learns to select actions to maximize long-term rewards—such as area coverage and bandit detection—while avoiding obstacles and collaborating implicitly with teammates.

Key RL Implementation Concepts
1. State (Observation)
Each drone's state should encode:
<ul>
<li>Its location.</li>

<li>The 3x3 sensory field (local map: ground/obstacle/bandit, blue/red flag).</li>

<li>Which cells it has visited recently (optional).</li>

<li>Relative positions of visible bandits and obstacles.</li>

<li>Optionally, a limited communication protocol with teammates.</li>
</ul>
<br>
2. Action Space
<ul>
<li>Move up, down, left, right, or stay.</li>
<li>(Optional: "Report bandit" if seen, or communicate.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
3. Reward Structure
<ul>
<li>+1 for visiting a previously uncovered ground cell.</li>

<li>+5 for detecting a new bandit.</li>

<li>-1 for attempted collision with obstacle or another drone.</li>

<li>(Optional: +N for achieving >90% coverage fast.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
4. Learning Algorithm
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Start simple: Tabular Q-learning if state space is small, or Deep Q-Network (DQN) for larger/partial observable states.</li>

<li>For swarms, use Multi-Agent RL:</li>

<li>Independent learners: Each drone trains its own Q-table or policy.</li>

<li>Centralized training, decentralized execution: Learn joint policy with global state in training, but only local state at runtime (e.g. MADDPG, MAPPO).</li>

<li>Use frameworks like PettingZoo, RLlib, or even custom gym environments for multi-agent training.</li>
</ul>
<br>

5. Integration with Your Simulation
<ul>
<li>Convert your current Pygame grid into a gym-like environment:</li>

<li>Implement reset(), step(action_dict), and render() functions.</li>

<li>Each step lets all drones choose actions (as a dict), environment updates states, calculates rewards, and returns observations/rewards for each.</li>

<li>During training, replace random drone moves with actions sampled from each agent’s evolving policy.</li>

<li>During RL agent evaluation, watch as drones learn to sweep, avoid getting stuck, coordinate, and seek bandits efficiently.</li>
</ul>
