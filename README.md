# RL Drone Surveillance Project - Development Log

## Project Overview
Development of a reinforcement learning-based drone surveillance system for efficient area coverage and bandit detection in obstacle-rich environments.

## Timeline and Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Pygame Simulation (Initial)
**Date**: Early Development  
**Objective**: Create foundational grid-based drone simulation

#### Implementation
- 10x10 grid environment with sprites (ground, obstacle, drone, bandit)
- Multiple drones with random movement patterns
- Basic obstacle avoidance
- Coverage tracking with blue flags for visited areas
- Red flags for bandit detection
- Visual sensory field display (3x3 vision range)

#### Issues Identified
- Random movement was inefficient
- No learning mechanism
- Drones often got stuck in local areas

### Phase 2: Console Panel Integration
**Date**: Development Session 1  
**Objective**: Improve visual debugging and information display

#### Implementation
- Added console panel below game grid
- Real-time statistics display (coverage, bandits detected, simulation status)
- Message logging system with scrolling capability
- Separation of game area from information display

#### Benefits
- Better visual debugging
- Non-intrusive information display
- Enhanced user experience

### Phase 3: Basic Q-Learning Integration
**Date**: Development Session 2  
**Objective**: Introduce reinforcement learning for intelligent drone behavior

#### Implementation
- Tabular Q-learning with state = (x, y) position
- Action space: [Up, Down, Left, Right, Stay]
- Reward structure:
  - +1 for visiting new cells
  - +10 for detecting bandits
  - -10 for hitting obstacles
- Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay

#### Issues Encountered
- **Problem**: Drone repeatedly hit walls/obstacles
- **Problem**: Drone stuck in repetitive movement loops
- **Problem**: Insufficient exploration of right side of grid

### Phase 4: Reward Engineering and Exploration Fixes
**Date**: Development Session 3  
**Objective**: Address exploration and repetitive behavior issues

#### Fixes Applied
1. **Enhanced reward structure**:
   - +2 reward for new cell visits (increased from +1)
   - -1 penalty for revisiting already-covered areas
   - Maintained +10 bonus for bandit detection

2. **Improved epsilon scheduling**:
   - Initial epsilon: 1.0 (full exploration)
   - Final epsilon: 0.05
   - Decay rate: 0.995 per episode

3. **Vision-based coverage**:
   - Drone covers entire 3x3 sensory field, not just current position
   - Reward based on newly visible cells in sensory range

#### Partial Success
- Reduced wall-hitting behavior
- Improved exploration patterns
- Still some repetitive behavior remained

### Phase 5: Advanced State Representation
**Date**: Development Session 4  
**Objective**: Solve persistent looping issues through better state encoding

#### Major Changes
1. **Rich state representation**:
   - State = (x, y, tuple of 3x3 sensory field)
   - Q-table changed from NumPy array to dictionary
   - States include local environment context

2. **Optimistic initialization**:
   - New states initialized with Q-values = 50 (optimistic)
   - Encourages exploration of unseen state-action pairs

3. **Legal action filtering**:
   - Prevented selection of actions leading to obstacles
   - Eliminated wall-hitting behavior completely

#### Results
- Significant reduction in repetitive behavior
- More intelligent navigation around obstacles
- Better coverage patterns

### Phase 6: Training Optimization
**Date**: Development Session 5  
**Objective**: Improve training efficiency and visualization

#### Implementation
- **Fast headless training**: No rendering during learning phase
- **Selective visualization**: Show only first 5, best 5, and last 5 episodes
- **Performance tracking**: Episode statistics storage and analysis

#### Benefits
- Dramatically reduced training time
- Better insight into learning progression
- Maintained visual debugging capabilities

### Phase 7: Stuck Detection and Intervention System
**Date**: Current Session  
**Objective**: Implement systematic solution for remaining stuck behaviors

#### New Features Implemented

1. **Stuck Detection Algorithm**:
